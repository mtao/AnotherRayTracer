# ART - Another RayTracer

ART has no purpose, but this is mostly rational.

# Mostly Rational
By rational I don't mean that this library actually uses rationals `Q=Z/(Z-{0})`, but rather uses the `double/(double-{0})` as accurately as possible.
The idea is that division is evil so we should try to stick to homogeneous-like coordinates as much as possible.
